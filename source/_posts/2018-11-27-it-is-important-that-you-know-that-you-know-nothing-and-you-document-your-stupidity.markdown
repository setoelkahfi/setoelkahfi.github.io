In this last week, I tried hard to understand the Octopress blogging platform. It's the platform that powered this blog. I tried so hard to understand the concept. And after so many trials and errors, I (maybe, am I?) finally understand how it works under the hood. It should be simple and easier concept for you smart developers, but I just realize that I'm not that smart.

So, realizing that I'm not so smart is an important step for me. That enables me to always try to document my stupidity. {"It can be a stupid Stackoverlow question, a meaningless GitHub repository, or an advance blogging platform."} I'm glad that I realize it and act based on it. My future self should thank my current version.

Now, I will try to routinely blogging technical stuffs in this blog. This is my way to separate different type of writings I conduct in other platform. Like, Wordpress.com for example. That's my very first blogging experience. I wrote mostly about daily life, in my native language, Indonesian. I also have blogspot blog, which I used to blog about technical stuffs in Indonesian as well. And off course other social channels, which also kind of micro blogging platform, because I also need to write something, at least. 

<h2>The Future Plan</h2>
I'll try to make all my writings as neat as possible. Maybe, in the future, I will make a single platform (possibly my dot com domain), that integrate all my digital footprints. Maybe I'll regret it, that I produce so many data in my life. Maybe I'll glad that I'm doing it. Who knows.
